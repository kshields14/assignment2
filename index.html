    <h2>Pizza Survey</h2>

    <h3>
      &#127829 &#127829 &#127829  Here is a quiz all about your
      personal pizza preferences! &#127829 &#127829	&#127829
    </h3>

    <p>
        Here is a simple survey to tell me about your own personal pizza
        preferences. When you submit your form, I will let you know what my
        preferences are (aka the right answers). See how we compare!
    </p>

    <h5>
      Question 1
    </h5>

    <p class="question">
      Okay, obvious first question here. It's 2am on a Friday. Sorrento's or
      Antoon's?
    </p>

    <input type="text" name = "Question 1" id="q1"><br>

    <h5>
      Question 2
    </h5>

    <p class="question">
      What is the best time of day to eat pizza?
    </p>

    <input type="text" name = "Question 2" id="q2"><br>

    <h5>
      Question 3
    </h5>

    <p class="question">
      What are your favorite pizza topping(s)?
    </p>

    <input type="text" name = "Question 3" id="q3"><br>

    <h5>
      Question 4
    </h5>

    <h5>
      Question 5
    </h5>

    <p class="question">
      And finally, if you had to choose between only eating pizza (but in any
      form - think pizza rolls, pizza bagels, etc.) or never have pizza again,
      what would you choose? Explain.
    </p>
